## Project Overview


## Resources
- Data Source: data.js

## Results
Five search fields are included in the filter search for date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
The UFO Sightings website is complete and includes a table with recorded sightings from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010
### Limitations
- One drawback of this design is that information that is typed into the fields must match exactly to the values contained within the table. For example, if someone searches for the city of "bakersfield", then one entry is returned.  However, if "Bakersfield" is entered as the search criterion, then no results are returned.
- Only thirteen days of January 2010 are included in the table, making this a narrow data set for searches.
### Recommendations
- Update the code to enable the date search field to search by month or year only when more dates are included.  Most individuals will not remember a specific day, but will more likely remember a month or year of a sighting.
- Update the code to allow for loose equality in search criteria.  This would allow string and number values to be input and give the same results.
- Continue to update information included in the table to include multiple years.
